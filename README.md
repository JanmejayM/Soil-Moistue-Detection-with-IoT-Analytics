# Soil-Moistue-Detection-with-IoT-Analytics

This project relates to soil moisture detection and automatic plant watering. The moisture sensor partially buried on soil continuously monitors the moisture of the soil. The data of Soil Moisture is sent to the ThingSpeak platform. The data on the Thingspeak Platform is directly transmitted to the app specially made for this project i.e. ”ESP_SOIL_MOISTURE” App. This data is also stored in ThingSpeak and also visual analysis is done using graphs. This continuous moisture analysis will also be useful for research and development purposes.
In addition to that, this project also comes with a minimum and maximum value of moisture percentage depending on which plants will be watered. The ability of this project to communicate via the internet makes it an “Internet of Things (IoT)” device. It also reduces the cost of the project and is more efficient when compared to its existing alternatives. This project is programmed using Thonny IDE in MicroPython language.
